<h1>Contribute</h1>
<p>A great conference is made with great contents. For great contents we need great
sponsors. Please join us in making foss-north 2026 the
best foss-north of them all by helping us bring together the best sponsors,
contents and audience!</p>
<p><a name="papers" class="offsetanchor"></a></p>
<h2>Call for Papers</h2>
<p>We are currently accepting contributions for foss-north 2026! Do you want to share something about free and open source software,
development methodologies, or other relevant topics? If so, we would love to
hear about it!</p>
<p>The Call for Papers is open until <b>Feb 15</b> and the
final speakers are contacted no later than <b>March 15</b>.
We are happy to sponsor travel expenses and accommodation, but cannot pay for
your time.  Please visit the <a href="https://foss-north.se/events/2026/callforpapers/">Call for Papers
registration page</a> to make your contribution. This will take you to a login
page. We use OAUTH2 for this and currently support GitHub and Google as ways to
authenticate. Please contact us if you want us to add more providers.</p>
<p>The call for paper form consists of a title for the talk, an abstract, name and
biography of the speaker, and preferred slot length (20 or 40 minutes, including
Q&amp;A). We also reimburse travel costs (up to 300 EUR) if needed. Since we
have a budget to work with, we ask for the approximate cost that you want us to
reimburse.</p>
<p>The event will be recorded and by submitting a talk proposal you agree to this.</p>
<p>Thank you for contributing!</p>
<p><a name="volunteers" class="offsetanchor"></a></p>
<h2>Call for Volunteers</h2>
<p>foss-north is a small conference, and most of the administration around it is
done by a very small team. During the actual conference however, we require more
manpower than that, for registration, speaker introductions, microphone running,
photography, filming talks, editing filmed talks, handling social media, etc.</p>
<p>If you like free and open source software, and if you want to help out with any
of the things mentioned above, reach out to <a href="mailto:info@foss-north.se">
info [at] foss-north.se</a>.  We are not able to pay anything for your help, but
you'll get a ticket to the conference, and we try to schedule our work so that
you will be able to attend any talks that are of particular interest to you.</p>
<p>If you are interested in joining the organizing group on a more permanent basis,
we welcome that, too!</p>

<h2>Call for Sponsors</h2>
<p>We want to create the meeting space for open source communities in the Nordic
region. The foss-north event is one step on that path. Nothing of this would be
possible by the support of our sponsors.</p>
<p>We are looking for sponsors of all sizes to be a part of the foss-north event.
We offer the following tiers:</p>
<div class="bodytext">
    <table class="table table-striped">

        <th class="leftalign">Benefit</th>
        <th>Base</th>
        <th>Silver</th>

    </tr>
    </thead>

        <td>10kSEK</td>
        <td>40kSEK</td>
        <td>75kSEK</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
