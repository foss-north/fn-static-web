                In this talk our two speakers from Ericsson and Nokia will try to share some best practices in how to talk to your legal department or outside legal counsel about FOSS, FOSS Licensing, Why and how to do FOSS, and finally (hopefully) getting the lawyers on your side in how your organizations consumes and contributes to open source.

            <div class="abstract">
                The speakers will use real life examples of their respective companies FOSS journeys over the last few years. Ultimately working with the legal department should be a partnership to manage risk, increase efficiency, and ensure that FOSS can be used and contributed to in a frictionless fashion. Why is then often legal department and legal counsel seen as at best a speedbump and at worst an enemy?

                It makes for a fantastic tool to reliably, step-by-step and with the virtues of trunk-based-development make small commits towards a predefined goal, with less cognitive load than is typical for medium- to big changes in code bases, avoiding anti-patterns such as analysis paralysis or large and hard-to-review pull-requests, bringing transparency to the whole team continuously on what is going on. The result: large changes that happen instead of ending up in some "big refactoring"-branch-graveyard.

                However, there are situations where the method is hard to use in practice. This talk will delve into some such situations - and perhaps give some suggestions on what you could do to come closer to using Mikado Method in your code base, getting all the real value of the method with time.

                Many organizational processes cross the boundaries of individual organizations. This is especially true for the academic sector where mobility programs like "Erasmus+" enable students to be enrolled with different universities throughout their studies. However, the technical means to enable the necessary collaboration between different institutions and their administrations are often not adequate. Many tools for group messaging, file exchange, or domain-specific applications do not work or lack functionality as soon as users or data from outside an organization are involved, such that E-Mail is a widely used fall-back.

                Based on terminology from the recent <i>Interoperable Europe Act - (IEA)</i> we will present technical and semantic <i>interoperability solutions</i> to address these issues. On the technical side, we present two existing protocols: OpenCloudMesh is an open file sharing protocol implemented by open-source solutions like Nextcloud and ownCloud. The Matrix protocol enables secure, decentralized group and instant messaging, but might also support further use cases like video conferences in the future.

                On the semantic side, we present a case study where we, based on existing vocabularies, model a university course catalog in the <i>Resource Description Framework (RDF)</i> serialization format JSON-LD. The RDF representation of the course data introduces a semantic context to the course data, making the exchange of the catalog data independent of specific APIs, thus enabling interoperability across heterogeneous data structures and university-specific systems.

Allowed you to modify both your hardware and software? We thought so too. And by chance, we ended up being the hardware manufacturer our-self to make it happen.

                Because the kernel code executes at the highest privilege level and a kernel bug usually crashes the whole system, many SREs, production engineers and system administrators try to avoid upgrading the kernel too often for the sake of stability. There is a tendency to create more obstacles to Linux kernel releases (requiring more approvals etc). But introducing all these obstacles and not treating kernel updates like any other software usually significantly increases the risk for the company and their service of being exploited.

            <div class="abstract">
                One of the reasons SREs and engineers are too afraid of ANY kernel upgrade is that they don’t actually know the details about Linux kernel release process and policy. This talk tries to demystify Linux Kernel releases and provides a guide on how to distinguish a kernel bugfix release from a feature release. We also describe how kernel releases are implemented in our company and propose possible approaches to deploy kernel upgrades regularly with minimal risk.

            <div class="abstract">
                Did you know that Linux has a full-featured keystore ready to be used by any application or service it runs? Applications can securely store and share credentials, secrets and cryptographic keys, sign and encrypt data, negotiate a common encryption key - all this by never touching a single byte of the underlying cryptographic material.
            </div>
            
            <div class="abstract">
                This is especially useful in the post-heartbleed and cloud-native environments, where services authenticate and securely talk to each other using some kind of credentials. But if a network-facing service also has some secret in its process address space, it sets itself up for a security failure as any potential out-of-bounds memory access vulnerability may allow the secret to be leaked. Imagine a world where you don’t have to run an SSH agent just to protect your SSH keys.

            <div class="abstract">
                On top of keeping your secrets secret Linux keystore nicely integrates with specialized security hardware, like TPMs and HSMs and may provide a single entry point on the system for applications to obtain their secrets. Thus Linux keystore is a very useful building block for a corporate key management system.

But there’s hope! From the CNCF to the OpenID Foundation, the open source community is doing some really neat stuff with authz right now.

                As we all know, Microsoft has a straightforward strategy that it shares with most other big tech firms from Silicon Valley: get all our data, then charge us for accessing it. MS 365 and Teams in particular are core to that strategy. This is why they gave it away 'for free' to so many organizations using COVID. To then turn around and send a bill after, because of course people USED it, uploading documents and such. So the lock-in was complete.

                There are a ton of open source alternatives, but none really answer this challenge, as most focus on one aspect - video calls, chat, document sharing... Some people 'frankensteined' solutions to integrate different tools, but user experience suffers and they are a nightmare to maintain. Open Source needs a singular, capable answer. And I argue that it exists - we announced it, December 3, 2024!

Instead, I affirm the power of mastering multiple fields and show how it can become your superpower.

                The Tillitis TKey is an innovative new USB hardware security device which allows running small applications in a more secure way. The applications can be used for things like authentication, cryptographic signing, generating random numbers, and similar functions.
            </div>
            
            <div class="abstract">
                To help emulate and secure the Tillitis TKey we added support for the TKey to the QEMU system emulator. This allows a developer of firmware or device apps to inspect, debug, and validate the functions, including observing memory like the stack, registers, et cetera, while running.

            <div class="abstract">
                Using an emulator with strong observability is immensely helpful not only when developing and debugging, but also when attempting to find out the impact of a security vulnerability. In this talk I will do a walkthrough of such a case.

                Engineering teams in companies at all levels ingest open-source dependencies nearly every day. No matter of if you’re developing commercial SW products or an IT department “just” utilizing it for the internal needs. Not all of them are at the same quality, even if provide similar functionality. For the very small project and If you have 1 or 2 open-source dependencies - you can evaluate what’s better manually, simply having a look at the repos, if you know what to look for. But when it comes to dozens and eventually hundreds of packages - it’s impossible to assess them all manually.

                Attacks on software supply chains (like high-profile Log4j vulnerability or Codecov attack or Python/NPM repo poisoning or intentionally malicious commits to XZ) showed us that we can’t rely on just random or “old good” open-source project without the proper verification, at each stage in your development pipeline.

                Let’s talk about health metrics and essential checks (e.g., based on CHAOSS and 8knot) that all developers should consider and how to easily automate them. I’ll show practical examples how industry leaders use tools like OpenSSF Scorecard and beyond to maintain open-source security posture at scale.
