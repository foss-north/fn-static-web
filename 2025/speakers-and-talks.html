                In this talk our two speakers from Ericsson and Nokia will try to share some best practices in how to talk to your legal department or outside legal counsel about FOSS, FOSS Licensing, Why and how to do FOSS, and finally (hopefully) getting the lawyers on your side in how your organizations consumes and contributes to open source.

                The speakers will use real life examples of their respective companies FOSS journeys over the last few years. Ultimately working with the legal department should be a partnership to manage risk, increase efficiency, and ensure that FOSS can be used and contributed to in a frictionless fashion. Why is then often legal department and legal counsel seen as at best a speedbump and at worst an enemy?

                Cryptographic algorithms are foundational to secure software, yet their declaration and tracking remain inconsistent across industries. To address this, SCANOSS published the crypto_algorithms_open_dataset (CC0 license), which was officially presented here at FOSSNorth in 2024 as part of a wider talk about SCANOSS open data journey.

                This open data set is a comprehensive resource cataloging cryptographic algorithms with open-source implementations. This initiative marked the first step toward standardizing cryptographic algorithm declarations in Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs). Such standardization can reduce inefficiencies in compliance and foster collaboration across industries—from export control and security compliance to quantum safety readiness, among other benefits, that will be highlighted during the talk.

                Many organizational processes cross the boundaries of individual organizations. This is especially true for the academic sector where mobility programs like "Erasmus+" enable students to be enrolled with different universities throughout their studies. However, the technical means to enable the necessary collaboration between different institutions and their administrations are often not adequate. Many tools for group messaging, file exchange, or domain-specific applications do not work or lack functionality as soon as users or data from outside an organization are involved, such that E-Mail is a widely used fall-back.

                Based on terminology from the recent <i>Interoperable Europe Act - (IEA)</i> we will present technical and semantic <i>interoperability solutions</i> to address these issues. On the technical side, we present two existing protocols: OpenCloudMesh is an open file sharing protocol implemented by open-source solutions like Nextcloud and ownCloud. The Matrix protocol enables secure, decentralized group and instant messaging, but might also support further use cases like video conferences in the future.

                On the semantic side, we present a case study where we, based on existing vocabularies, model a university course catalog in the <i>Resource Description Framework (RDF)</i> serialization format JSON-LD. The RDF representation of the course data introduces a semantic context to the course data, making the exchange of the catalog data independent of specific APIs, thus enabling interoperability across heterogeneous data structures and university-specific systems.

            <div class="abstract">
                Because the kernel code executes at the highest privilege level and a kernel bug usually crashes the whole system, many SREs, production engineers and system administrators try to avoid upgrading the kernel too often for the sake of stability. There is a tendency to create more obstacles to Linux kernel releases (requiring more approvals etc). But introducing all these obstacles and not treating kernel updates like any other software usually significantly increases the risk for the company and their service of being exploited.
            </div>
            
            <div class="abstract">
                One of the reasons SREs and engineers are too afraid of ANY kernel upgrade is that they don’t actually know the details about Linux kernel release process and policy. This talk tries to demystify Linux Kernel releases and provides a guide on how to distinguish a kernel bugfix release from a feature release. We also describe how kernel releases are implemented in our company and propose possible approaches to deploy kernel upgrades regularly with minimal risk.

            <div class="abstract">
                Did you know that Linux has a full-featured keystore ready to be used by any application or service it runs? Applications can securely store and share credentials, secrets and cryptographic keys, sign and encrypt data, negotiate a common encryption key - all this by never touching a single byte of the underlying cryptographic material.
            </div>
            
            <div class="abstract">
                This is especially useful in the post-heartbleed and cloud-native environments, where services authenticate and securely talk to each other using some kind of credentials. But if a network-facing service also has some secret in its process address space, it sets itself up for a security failure as any potential out-of-bounds memory access vulnerability may allow the secret to be leaked. Imagine a world where you don’t have to run an SSH agent just to protect your SSH keys.
            </div>
            
            <div class="abstract">
                On top of keeping your secrets secret Linux keystore nicely integrates with specialized security hardware, like TPMs and HSMs and may provide a single entry point on the system for applications to obtain their secrets. Thus Linux keystore is a very useful building block for a corporate key management system.

                In a world that often celebrates specialisation, the generalist's path is frequently misunderstood. What is a generalist, and why is this diverse skill set your greatest asset? Celebrating polymaths like Leonardo da Vinci and Natalie Portman, I challenge the notion that being a 'jack of all trades, master of none' is a drawback. Instead, I affirm the power of mastering multiple fields and show how it can become your superpower.

Ultimately working with the legal department should be a partnership to manage risk, increase efficiency, and ensure that FOSS can be used and contributed to in a frictionless fashion. Why is then often legal department and legal counsel seen as at best a speedbump and at worst an enemy?

                To help emulate and secure the Tillitis TKey we added support for the TKey to the QEMU system emulator. This allows a developer of firmware or device apps to inspect, debug, and validate the functions, including observing memory like the stack, registers, et cetera, while running.
